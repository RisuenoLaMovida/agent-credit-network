# ACN Cost Reduction & Additional Features

## 💰 **COST REDUCTION STRATEGIES**

### **Current Deployment Cost: ~$100-150**

**Why so expensive?**
- Multiple large contracts
- Complex features (flash loans, bundling, insurance)
- Multiple deployments on testnet + mainnet

### **Cost Cutting Options:**

#### **1. LAZY DEPLOYMENT (Recommended)**
Deploy core features first, add others via upgrades

**Phase 1 ($30-40):**
- Core lending (borrow/lend/repay)
- Basic credit scoring
- 2.5% platform fee

**Phase 2 ($40-50) - After revenue:**
- Auto-repayment
- Flash loans
- Insurance pool

**Phase 3 ($30-40) - After more revenue:**
- Cross-chain
- AI risk assessment
- Advanced features

**Total: Still $100-150 but spread out!**

#### **2. OPTIMIZE CONTRACT SIZE**
- Use libraries for shared code
- Remove redundant functions
- Compress strings
- **Savings: 20-30%**

#### **3. DEPLOY ON CHEAPER CHAINS FIRST**
- **Base:** ~$50-70 (cheaper than Polygon)
- **Arbitrum Nova:** ~$30-40
- Launch on cheap chain → Bridge later

#### **4. USE PROXY PATTERN**
- Deploy proxy once
- Upgrade logic contracts
- **Savings: 60% on upgrades**
